The Nautilus system admins team recently deployed a web UI application for their backup utility running on the Nautilus backup server in Stratos Datacenter. 
The application is running on port 6200. They have firewalld installed on that server. The requirements that have come up include the following:



Open all incoming connection on 6200/tcp port. Zone should be public.

ssh clit@stbkp01
systemctl status firewalld
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=6200/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
