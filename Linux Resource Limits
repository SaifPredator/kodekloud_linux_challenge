On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, 
which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:
a. soft limit = 1024
b. hard_limit = 2025
ssh natasha@ststor01

Add the following lines at the end of the file to set the soft and hard process limits for the nfsuser user:

vi /etc/security/limits.conf
nfsuser soft nproc 1024
nfsuser hard nproc 2025
